The examps file contains some examples used during the project and it is not really interesting to look at.
The compiledJavascript file contains the whole compiler output, so 8000+ lines. It has been fairly commented, but is very unpractical to go 
through it, so we wouldn't recommend it.
The ElmProgram file contains the compiled code of a webpage, but only those lines where the actual user written program is. We looked at some more example wepages
but this was the only one we commented.
